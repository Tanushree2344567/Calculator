# Calculator
A calculator is a tool for performing mathematical calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex scientific and statistical functions.

Creating a calculator using HTML and CSS involves structuring the layout and styling the elements to resemble a functional calculator interface.

HTML Structure:

Container: Create a <div> element to serve as the container for the calculator.
Display: Use an <input> element with type="text" to display the input and output.
Buttons: Create <button> elements for each digit (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and other functions (clear, equals).


CSS Styling:

Layout: Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to arrange the calculator buttons in a grid-like or row/column layout.
Button Styles: Style buttons for visual appeal using padding, background colors, borders, and hover effects.
Display Styling: Style the input display to resemble a calculator screen, with appropriate font size, alignment, and border.

Functional Design:

Button Clicks: Use JavaScript (not covered in CSS/HTML alone) to handle button clicks and perform calculations.
Responsive Design: Ensure the calculator layout adjusts smoothly on different screen sizes using media queries in CSS.
Accessibility: Ensure buttons are accessible and clickable, with appropriate keyboard support for numeric and functional input.


Testing and Refinement:

Functionality Testing: Test the calculator to ensure all buttons and functions work as expected.
User Interface: Refine the UI for usability and clarity, considering user feedback if applicable.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Check compatibility across different browsers to ensure consistent functionality and appearance.



By following these steps, you can create a functional and visually appealing calculator using HTML and CSS. For advanced functionality (like actual calculation logic), JavaScript would be necessary, but the above steps focus on the HTML and CSS aspects.
